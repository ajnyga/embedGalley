# embedGalley

For OJS 3.3.0

EmbedGalley plugin automatically converts a JATS XML galley to embedded HTML, which is shown on the abstract page.

The plugin is using some code and XSL files from https://github.com/PeerJ/jats-conversion. Thank you!


Possible changes:
- Switch to using the new OJS parser
- New citation formats (currently only APA)
- Settings for switching between citation formats
- Activate/disable MathJax from settings
- allow custom CSS
- clean XSL
